Creating Cleaned WEO Data Set
================

# Introduction

Okay! Lets Get Going. I am using the World MacroEconomic Outlook data
published by IMF twice a year. For the purpose of this presentation, I
am usig the lastest dataset available in the series i.e.Â October 2023.

## Data Summary

Lets look at how the data look like!! We can see that it is very messy
and disorganized. It is Raw. It is in complex and unstructured format.
Without proper organization, labeling, and formatting, raw data can be
overwhelming and difficult to interpret. Additionally, it contains
missing or erroneous information. Instead of variable names we have
years in the columns and all the economic determinants are under WEO
subject code and discription columns. Lets Clean it, step by step.

## Filtering Out

I am going to use selected 10 economic indicators out of many under the
WEO Subject Code column. Lets Rename the column names and filter out a
shorter dataset with the indicators we are interested inâ¦

``` r
weo  %<>% 
  rename("Subject_Code" = "WEO Subject Code")
weo  %<>% 
  rename("Country_Code" = "WEO Country Code")

weo1 = weo %>% 
  filter(Subject_Code == 'NGDP_RPCH' | Subject_Code == 'PPPSH'|
         Subject_Code == 'PCPIPCH' | Subject_Code == 'LUR' |
           Subject_Code == 'LE' |  Subject_Code == 'LP'| 
           Subject_Code == 'GGR_NGDP' | Subject_Code == 'GGX_NGDP' |
           Subject_Code == 'GGXWDN_NGDP' | Subject_Code ==  'BCA_NGDPD')
```

## Pivoting Longer

The need to pivot longer arises when data is stored in a format that
makes it difficult to analyze, we can see that we have year numbers as
columns so by bringing all year columns under one column called âyearâ,
we can create a more organized and structured dataset that is easier to
work with. We put all the values under different years in a new coulumn
called âValuesâ. Doing both of these things allows us to conduct trend
analysis, perform calculations, and draw insights across multiple years
without having to refer to each individual column separately. Then, I am
selecting the specific columns from the dataset to carry out further
cleaning.

``` r
weo2 =
  weo1 %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(31:50),
    names_to = 'year',
    names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
    values_to = 'Values'
  )

weo3 =
  weo2 %>% 
  select(Country, ISO, Country_Code, Subject_Code, year, Values)
```

## Pivoting Wider

With following codes, I am widening the dataset and creating a new ID
Variable. I am converting chosen indicators under Subject Code column
into seperate variables and assigning them values from the âValuesâ
variable.

``` r
weo4 =
  weo3 %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = Subject_Code ,
    values_from = Values
  )  

weo4 %<>%  #creating a ID variable
  mutate(
    RID = row_number(), .before = 1
  )
```

## Final touch

With this code chunk, I am further cleaning the dataset. Renaming the
variables, making implicit NAs explicit and converting the character
variables (those are supposed to be numeric) into numeric. I am also
creating an ordered factor variable with a cool function. Until this
step, we were working on a matrix which will also be converted into a
proper dataset and select the columns which we are interested in having
in our dataset:

``` r
weo4  %<>% 
  rename("YEAR" = "year")
weo4  %<>% 
  rename("COUNTRY" = "Country")       

val_repl <- c('n/a') #replacing the implit n/a into explicit NA
weo5 = sapply(weo4,                           
                    function(x) replace(x, x %in% val_repl, NA))
weo5 = as.data.frame(weo5)



vec = c(6:15) #converting certain charater varibles into numeric 
weo5[ , vec] = apply(weo5[ , vec,drop=F], 2,          
                            function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))
```

## Codebook

Now the coolest thing ever! We can create a codebook with all the
essential information about variables using just one code command. But
you need to make sure that you have described each variable. Here I am
adding source and description to all the variables followed by the code
to print the code book as a word file. Remember, you must edit the
codebook to remove undesired content and add important stuff. You can
compare the output of this codes with the code book I have uploaded in
this repository.

``` r
weo7 = weo6 %>%
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    RID,
    description = "Serial Number",
    source = "Created by R code"
  ) %>%
  
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    COUNTRY,
    description = "IMF Member Country",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>%
  
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    ISO,
    description = "Country Code for IMF Member Country",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>%
  
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    YEAR,
    description = "Year",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>%
  
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    NGDP_RPCH,
    description = "% in Gross domestic product, constant prices",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
   
  ) %>% 
  
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    PPPSH,
    description = "Gross domestic product based on purchasing-power-parity share of world total",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>% 
  
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    PCPIPCH,
    description = "% in Inflation, average consumer prices",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>% 
  
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    LUR,
    description = "% of population Unemployed",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>% 
  
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    UR,
    description = "Nature of Unemployment",
    source = "created from LUR variable"
  ) %>%
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    LP,
    description = "Population in Millions",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>% 
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    GGR_NGDP,
    description = "General government revenue as % of GDP",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>%
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    GGX_NGDP,
    description = "General government Expenditure as % of GDP",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>%
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    GGXWDN_NGDP,
    description = "General government net debt as % of GDP",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>% 
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    SUS,
    description = "Nature of Debt",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  ) %>%
  cb_add_col_attributes(
    BCA_NGDPD,
    description = "Current Account Balance as % of GDP",
    source = "World Economic Outlook Database 2022"
  )
```

    ## The following attribute(s) are being added to a variable in the data frame for the first time: description, source. If you believe this/these attribute(s) were previously added, then check for a typo in the attribute name. If you are adding this/these attribute(s) for the first time, you can probably safely ignore this message.

``` r
codebook = codebook(weo7)  
print(codebook, target = "codebook_1.docx")  
 

library("writexl") 
write.csv(weo7, "C:/Users/bharg/OneDrive/Desktop/SIS/Data Analysis/awd/World Macroeconomic Outlook.csv", row.names=FALSE)
save(weo7, file = "World macroeconomic Outlook.RData")
```

## CONCLUSION

With this code chunk, I cleaned a very disorderly available World
Macro-Economic Outlook data set and gave a step by step overview of
codes used and reason there off.

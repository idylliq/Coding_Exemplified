# Coding_Exemplified: Cleaning the World Macroeconomic Outlook Dataset
This project aims to clean the World Macroeconomic Outlook dataset and make it ready for analysis. The dataset contains macroeconomic indicators of various countries, and it is available on the International Monetary Fund's website. The cleaned dataset can be used to conduct a wide range of analyses, such as trend analysis, forecasting, and modeling.

## Dataset
The World Macroeconomic Outlook dataset contains data on several macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and trade balance, for various countries. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be downloaded from the IMF's website.

## Cleaning Process
The cleaning process involved several steps, including:

Data extraction: The dataset was downloaded from the IMF's website and saved in a local directory.

Data exploration: The dataset was explored to identify missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Data cleaning: The missing values were imputed using appropriate methods, such as mean imputation or interpolation. The outliers were either removed or treated using appropriate statistical methods. The inconsistent values were corrected manually.

Data transformation: The dataset was transformed to a tidy format, where each row represents a unique observation, and each column represents a variable.

Data export: The cleaned dataset was saved in `.Rdata` format and made available on GitHub Page.
